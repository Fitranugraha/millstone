          <p>Millstone is a distributed bioinformatics software platform designed to facilitate genome engineering for synthetic biology. Millstone automates iterative design, analysis, and debugging for projects involving hundreds of bacterial genomes.</p>

          <p>This demo server is contains 4 projects described in our forthcoming manuscript. The genomes in each of these projects have already been aligned, and variants have been called and annotated. You can compare, visualize, and explore the effects of both the designed and unintended variants within them.</p>

          <p>Uploading samples, performing new alignments, and creating and manipulating variant sets are all disabled for this demo.</p>
