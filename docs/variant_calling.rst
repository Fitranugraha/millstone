Variant Calling
===============

Our variant calling pipeline has three major components:

* SNV calling
* Structural Variant calling
* Effect prediction

SNV Calling
-----------

We use Freebayes.  See: https://github.com/ekg/freebayes.

Structural Variant Calling
--------------------------

TODO

Effect Prediction
-----------------

UPSTREAM/DOWNSTREAM - We set a default of 50bp to look for upstream/downstream
effects.
